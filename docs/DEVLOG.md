## 2026-08-04 — Git init + Phase 0 FRDs
- Initialized the Git repository (branch `main`) and added a `.gitignore` (Python, Node/Angular,
  secrets/`.env`, Docker data volumes).
- Wrote the three **Phase 0 FRDs**:
  - `FRD-000-foundation-infra` — monorepo layout, Docker Compose stack (Postgres, Keycloak, Kafka
    +schema-registry, Vault), service skeletons, shared `libs/`, CI + coverage gate, Make targets.
  - `FRD-001-observability-baseline` — OTLP → OTel Collector → SigNoz, app instrumentation, trace
    context propagation over HTTP + Kafka, correlated logs/metrics.
  - `FRD-002-seed-and-demo-mode` — `DEMO_MODE`, mock upstream (basic), idempotent extensible
    seed framework covering all five roles, deterministic data.
- **Next:** implement Phase 0, starting with `FRD-000` (Compose stack + skeletons + CI).

## 2026-08-04 — Project kickoff & planning foundation
- Established project vision and scope; created **`docs/PRD.md`** (Project Requirements Document v0.1).
- Created **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — phased delivery plan (Phase 0–7).
- Added **`docs/features/FRD-TEMPLATE.md`** and **`README.md`**.
- Locked key decisions:
  - Management UI = **Angular + Django REST Framework** → `ADR-0001`.
  - Local observability = **OTel Collector + SigNoz** (alt: Grafana LGTM) → `ADR-0002`.
  - Docs & code in **English**; **Docker Compose** locally; **automated seeding** + demo mode required.
- Created **`CLAUDE.md`** (project guidance) and set up **`docs/adr/`** (ADR process + first two ADRs).
- **Next:** write Phase 0 FRDs (`FRD-000` foundation, `FRD-001` observability, `FRD-002` seed/demo),
  then begin implementation of Phase 0 (Foundation & Infra).
